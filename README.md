# Factor-GAN
As the core branch of artificial intelligence, deep learning has become increasingly influential in the financial domain due to its potent data processing capabilities. This paper introduces Factor-GAN, an innovative framework leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology for factor investing. 

By harnessing a factor database comprising 70 firm characteristics, Factor-GAN integrates deep learning techniques with the multi-factor pricing model, thereby elevating the precision and stability of investment strategies. To explain the economic mechanisms underlying deep learning, we conduct a subsample analysis of the Chinese stock market. 

The findings reveal that the deep learning-based pricing model significantly enhances return prediction accuracy and factor investment performance in comparison to linear models.  Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the long-short portfolio under Factor-GAN, demonstrating an annualized return of 23.52\% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.29. During the transition from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to non-SOEs, our study discerns shifts in factor importance, with liquidity and volatility gaining significance while fundamental indicators diminish. Additionally, A-share listed companies display a heightened emphasis on momentum and growth indicators relative to their dual-listed counterparts.
